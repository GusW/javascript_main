# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counters

- Uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- Can often avoid the need for nested loops - O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings

## Multiple Pointers Pattern

- Creating pointer or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## Sliding Window Pattern

- Involves creating a window which can either be a array or number from one position to another
- Depending on certain conditions, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
- Useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string

## Divide and Conquer Pattern

- Involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
- Decrease time complexity
